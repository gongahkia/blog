      <p>An enthralling look into the hobby of one of the 20th century’s most influential eastern literature writers, which comes off feeling like it isn’t detailed enough despite Murakami’s distinct descriptive style being ever-present (and that’s a compliment, not a piece of criticism).</p>

      <p>I think What I Talk About When I Talk About Running resonated so strongly with me because I have at one point in my life pursued running (and longer-distance running) with an obsession and drive that arose from the same place he describes throughout the book, and I suspect this is the same point of origin from which most endurance athletes derive their motivation.</p>

      <p>Either way, I basically couldn’t stop having “he’s like me, for real” moments while reading this book. That, and it’s overall just a goldmine for great quotes.</p>

      <p>Definitely my favorite Murakami book, don’t know if this necessarily even qualifies as a ‘story’ of his given it’s autobiographical nature but I enjoyed it immensely. Ordering a hardcover edition of it for my birthday this year.</p>

      <p><i>Sidenote: Murakami is the only man on the planet capable of convincing me that I can and should participate in a half-marathon, marathon, ultra-marathon and triathlon tomorrow. He’s really out here describing some of the most grueling challenges of physical endurance known to man as a yearly affair.</i></p>
