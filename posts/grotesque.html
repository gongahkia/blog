        <p>Haven't read something that has made me this uncomfortable in quite a while. Objectively speaking though (and parroting my previous review), Natsuo Kirino might be the definitive leader in the Crime Thriller genre of Japanese literature. Her grasp of multiperspectivity not as a gimmick, but as a weapon that breathes life into each individual within her twisted worlds is on full display within <i>Grotesque</i>. If it's true that <i>Out</i> has a tighter plot structure <i>Real World</i> has the best replication of the fractured psyche of Japanese Youth, then <i>Grotesque</i> wins out for its sheer, unbridled focus on strong character writing above all else. </p>

        <p>None of the individuals within <i>Grotesque</i> come close to being sane, but Kirino's writing is compelling to the extent that she convinces you of the reasonableness of their delusions. </p>

        <p>Maybe it's for this reason that I enjoyed <i>Grotesque</i> all the more despite it's subject matter making it near impossible for me to read on public transport, summarise or recommend. </p>

        <p>By flittering near constantly between different perspectives and time periods, Kirino traces the accursed paths of each of <i>Grotesque</i>'s characters so intricately that by the end, it's sombre conclusion appears unmistakeable and by no means incidental.</p>

        <p>Highly recommend this read, but please educate yourself on the book's subject matter beforehand.</p>
